# Angular Component Creation Prompt

## Goal

Develop a new component in this Angular project according to the DDD architecture, TypeScript, and Angular guidelines. Each step must be completed and tested before proceeding to the next.

## Steps

1. **Create Component**
   - Create the component under `src/app/<domain>/<component>`:
     - Use Angular CLI to generate the component.
     - Follow DDD and Sheriff module boundary rules.
     - **Write unit tests for the component. Only proceed when all tests pass.**
2. **Download Figma**
   - Download the Figma design file for the component using #Framelink Figma MCP.
   - Inspect the design for layout, spacing, and styling details.
   - Download images if needed.
3. **Apply Figma to Component**
   - Update the component's HTML and CSS to match the Figma design.
   - Ensure all styles are encapsulated within the component.
4. **Make Component responsive**
   - Use CSS media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.
   - Test the component's responsiveness in various viewport sizes.
