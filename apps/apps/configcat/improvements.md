Based on analyzing the code from `apps/configcat`, here are some improvement ideas and selling points:

## Improvements

1. **Enhanced Security Features**
  - Implement proper encryption for sensitive values (currently only replacing "JWE" with "password")
  - Add role-based access control for configuration management

2. **Version Control**
  - Track change history for configurations
  - Allow rollbacks to previous versions
  - Implement approval workflows for configuration changes

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**
  - Interactive visualization of nested configuration properties
  - Side-by-side comparison of environments (dev/test/prod)
  - Improved search and filtering capabilities

4. **Integration Capabilities**
  - Webhooks for configuration changes
  - CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Notifications system for critical changes

5. **Enhanced Documentation**
  - AI-assisted property descriptions based on usage patterns
  - Import/export documentation in various formats (beyond CSV)

## Selling Points

1. **Configuration as a Service**
  - Market as a centralized configuration management solution
  - Multi-tenant architecture for enterprise use

2. **Cost Reduction**
  - Prevent costly configuration errors through validation
  - Reduce debugging time with clear documentation
  - Decrease onboarding time for new developers

3. **Compliance and Governance**
  - Audit trails for all configuration changes
  - Validation against compliance rules
  - Scheduled exports for documentation requirements

4. **Feature Toggle Management**
  - A/B testing capabilities
  - Gradual feature rollouts
  - User segment targeting

5. **Competitive Advantage**
  - Position against existing tools like LaunchDarkly with focus on documentation
  - Emphasize the hybrid approach (documentation + configuration management)
  - Stress the self-hosted option for security-conscious customers

Adding these features would transform this from a basic configuration tool to a comprehensive configuration management platform.
