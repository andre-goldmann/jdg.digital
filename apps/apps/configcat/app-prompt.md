Generate an application to manage spring-application config files for different tenants.
Within the application it should be possible to:
- upload a config file for a tenant
- download a config file for a tenant
- delete a config file for a tenant
- edit a config file for a tenant
- document properties of a config file for a tenant
- list all config files for a tenant
- search for a config file for a tenant
- view the history of a config file for a tenant
- view the diff of a config file for a tenant
- view the metadata of a config file for a tenant
- view the content of a config file for a tenant
- view the size of a config file for a tenant
- view the type of a config file for a tenant
- view the last modified date of a config file for a tenant
- view the created date of a config file for a tenant
- view the owner of a config file for a tenant
- view the permissions of a config file for a tenant
- view the tags of a config file for a tenant
- view the status of a config file for a tenant

One of the most important features of the application is to be able to document the property of the config files.

The application should be written using angular and angular-material.
