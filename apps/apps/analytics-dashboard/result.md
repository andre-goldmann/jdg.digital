# Financial Analysis: aal

## Executive Summary
American Airlines (aal) demonstrates a mixed financial profile. The company has shown a strong recovery in revenue following a significant downturn in 2020, with revenues exceeding pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Profitability, however, remains relatively low with net margins below 2%, indicating that a large portion of revenue is consumed by operating expenses and other costs.

The balance sheet reveals increasing assets, but also increasing liabilities, leading to a high debt-to-equity ratio. Cash flow generation has improved in recent years, but capital expenditures continue to consume a significant portion of operating cash flow. Overall, while revenue growth is a positive sign, profitability and the high debt load are areas of concern.

| 2023 Q4 | 13.8 |
| 2024 Q1 | 12.6 |

American Airlines has demonstrated a strong recovery in revenue since the dramatic drop in 2020 due to the pandemic. The company has surpassed pre-pandemic revenue levels, achieving $52.8B in 2023. The growth rate has slowed down in 2023 to 7.7% compared to the previous year's 63.8%.

Quarterly revenue shows a consistent performance throughout 2023, followed by a slight decrease in Q1 2024. This could be attributed to seasonal variations or other market factors affecting the airline industry.

## Profitability Analysis

| Year | Gross Profit ($B) | Gross Margin (%) | Net Income ($B) | Net Margin (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2019 | 12.0 | 26.2 | 1.7 | 3.7 |
| 2020 | 2.2 | 12.6 | -8.9 | -51.3 |
| 2021 | 7.3 | 24.4 | -2.0 | -6.7 |
| 2022 | 11.6 | 23.7 | 0.9 | 1.9 |
| 2023 | 12.2 | 23.1 | 0.8 | 1.6 |

The gross margin has been relatively stable over the last three years, hovering around 23-24%. However, net income and net margin remain low, indicating that the company struggles to convert revenue into profit after accounting for all expenses. The net margin of 1.6% in 2023 indicates that cost management and other operational efficiencies could be areas for improvement.

The negative net income in 2020 and 2021 was likely due to the significant decrease in revenue related to the pandemic. While net income has turned positive, the margins are still thin.

## Balance Sheet Strength

| Year | Assets ($B) | Liabilities ($B) | Equity ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2019 | 59.8 | 46.5 | 13.3 |
| 2020 | 52.8 | 45.4 | 7.4 |
| 2021 | 58.6 | 52.4 | 6.3 |
| 2022 | 62.1 | 55.5 | 6.7 |
| 2023 | 67.8 | 60.4 | 7.4 |

| Year | Debt-to-Equity Ratio |
|---|---|
| 2019 | 3.5 |
| 2020 | 6.2 |
| 2021 | 8.4 |
| 2022 | 8.3 |
| 2023 | 8.2 |

| Year | Cash Position ($B) | Current Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| 2019 | 7.5 | 0.8 |
| 2020 | 9.5 | 0.9 |
| 2021 | 9.6 | 0.8 |
| 2022 | 7.3 | 0.8 |
| 2023 | 6.4 | 0.8 |

The balance sheet shows a consistent increase in both assets and liabilities over the past five years. While assets have grown, the liabilities have grown at a similar pace, resulting in a relatively stable equity position. The debt-to-equity ratio is high, indicating a significant reliance on debt financing.

The current ratio remains below 1, suggesting potential liquidity issues. The cash position has decreased in the last two years, which could further strain liquidity.

## Cash Flow Analysis

| Year | Operating Cash Flow ($B) | Capital Expenditures ($B) | Free Cash Flow ($B) | FCF Margin (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2019 | 8.0 | 3.4 | 4.6 | 10.1 |
| 2020 | 0.2 | 1.6 | -1.4 | -7.8 |
| 2021 | 4.5 | 2.1 | 2.4 | 8.0 |
| 2022 | 6.5 | 3.0 | 3.5 | 7.1 |
| 2023 | 8.0 | 3.2 | 4.8 | 9.0 |

American Airlines' cash flow generation capability has improved significantly since 2020. The operating cash flow has steadily increased, reaching $8.0B in 2023, which is similar to 2019 levels. Capital expenditures have remained relatively stable, resulting in increasing free cash flow.

The free cash flow margin has also improved but remains below the 2019 level. The company's ability to generate positive free cash flow is a positive sign, enabling it to invest in growth opportunities, reduce debt, or return value to shareholders.

## Capital Allocation

| Year | R&D Expenses (% of Revenue) | Capital Expenditures (% of Revenue) |
|---|---|---|
| 2019 | 0.0 | 7.5 |
| 2020 | 0.0 | 9.2 |
| 2021 | 0.0 | 7.0 |
| 2022 | 0.0 | 6.1 |
| 2023 | 0.0 | 6.1 |

American Airlines does not allocate any portion of its revenue to Research and Development. Capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue has been relatively stable, around 6-7% in the most recent years. This suggests a consistent investment in maintaining and upgrading its fleet and infrastructure.

The lack of R&D investment could be a concern, as innovation is crucial for long-term competitiveness in the airline industry. However, the stable capital expenditure suggests a commitment to maintaining its existing assets.

## Growth Trends

| Metric | 3-Year CAGR (%) | 5-Year CAGR (%) | 10-Year CAGR (%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue CAGR | 25.5 | 3.7 | 2.1 |
| Gross Profit CAGR | 6.0 | 0.5 | N/A |
| Net Income CAGR | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Free Cash Flow CAGR | 24.4 | 0.6 | N/A |

The 3-year revenue CAGR is significantly higher than the 5-year and 10-year CAGRs, reflecting the strong recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn. However, the growth rate has slowed down in the most recent year.

The Net Income CAGR cannot be calculated due to the negative values in some years. The free cash flow CAGR shows a similar trend to revenue, with a strong 3-year growth rate.

## Earnings Performance

| Quarter | Actual EPS | Estimated EPS | Surprise (%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 Q1 | 0.05 | 0.03 | 66.7 |
| 2023 Q2 | 1.92 | 1.59 | 20.8 |
| 2023 Q3 | 0.38 | 0.40 | -5.0 |
| 2023 Q4 | -0.27 | -0.29 | -6.9 |
| 2024 Q1 | -1.14 | -1.20 | -5.0 |

The earnings performance has been mixed. While the company has exceeded estimated EPS in some quarters, it has also missed estimates in others. The surprise percentages have varied significantly, indicating some inconsistency in earnings.

The negative EPS in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 could be a cause for concern, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining profitability.
