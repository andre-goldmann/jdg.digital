2. **Advanced Animations** - Polish and delight
3. **Modern Design System** - Visual consistency

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Voice Integration

- Requires Web Speech API implementation
- Need to handle browser compatibility
- Implement error handling and fallbacks

### AI Integration

- Consider using OpenAI API or similar for natural language processing
- Implement server-side processing for AI calls
- Add proper error handling and rate limiting

### Animation System

- Could use Angular Animations API instead of Framer Motion
- Focus on performance and accessibility
- Implement reduced motion preferences

### State Management

- Current NgRx Signals approach is solid
- Consider unified state for voice commands
- Add real-time synchronization features

## Conclusion

The Angular wellsync app provides a solid foundation with good architecture and basic functionality. The most significant opportunity for enhancement lies in adding AI/voice capabilities, which would differentiate it significantly from basic wellness apps. The breathing exercise component and progress visualization would also add substantial value to the user experience.

The current multi-route approach in Angular is valid and doesn't necessarily need to change to match Zent's single-page approach, but adding voice navigation and AI recommendations would bridge the feature gap effectively.
